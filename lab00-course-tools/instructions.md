# Lab 0: Course Tools

*Due: Tuesday, September 1, 2020* 

Your assignment is to simply create accounts in the online tools we'll be using this semester in CSC 170 if not already.  

Optionally, you should to introduce yourself to the other students in CSC 170 because it's beneficial to work in groups.  Although you'll be turning-in all your assignments and projects individually, when we get into  more difficult topics like webpage design it's okay to work in groups, so it's important to know who's who.

Also optionally, we can help you use industry-standard tools like Git and GitHub which might help you manage your assignments in your own code repository.  It'll be more to learn and more work at first, but you can abandon it later and do things "the old fashioned way" if you don't *click* with it. 

## Access the CSC 170 Workspace in Slack

### Step 1: Create your Slack account for CSC 170

We will use Slack as our primary way to keep in contact with each other, and you'll use Slack to get technical help in lieu of attending an in-person lab

- Go to [join.slack.com/t/csc170/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/csc170/signup) and setup your account (if you haven't already)

### Step 2: Introduce Yourself 

*This part is an OPTIONAL activity, but you'll find it's helpful as we go through the semester.*

The best study groups are made of students with technical skills that compliment each other, so that's why you should get to know the other students in CSC 170.

- Go to the **#chatter** channel in the CSC 170 Slack Workspace
- Create a new message to introduce yourself; write whatever you want; minimally:
  - Your nickname, or how you like to be referred to if different from your *display name* in Slack
  - Your major(s), minor(s), et cetera
  - Any clubs or teams to which you belong
  - Your abilities in any of the following, which will be important to know later in CSC 170:
    - Previous experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (not counting website builder tools like Wix, Squarespace, etc.)
    - Graphic design including photography
    - Other technical/computer skills
  - ...be sure to list courses you're taking or have taken related to these things^

# Git and GitHub

*This is an OPTIONAL activity - not graded, but a good industry practice.*

Our lab assignments and projects will be built one upon the other, which lends itself to "Branching" and Forking" in a code sharing environment like GitHub. So if you would like to use GitHub or learn about this industry-standard tool, go ahead and set up an account, or be prepared to use your existing account.  

- If you haven't already, [create an account in GitHub](https://github.com/join)

...and then:

- Recommended, but optional: [install the Git software](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer (if you're comfortable working in a command line environment)
  - NOTE: Git is not the same thing as GitHub ...we'll talk about this in Monday's lab
  - OR, if you are not a fan of working in a command line environment or you don't know what that is...
- Install the [GitHub Desktop software application](https://desktop.github.com) instead.  
- Here is a good introduction if you need to learn basic Git concepts and commands: [An Introduction to Git and GitHub by Brian Yu (YouTube 38:26)](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A)
